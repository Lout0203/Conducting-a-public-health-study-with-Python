Public health study with Python
Introduction
This project aims to give an overview of the state of malnutrition in the world, based on data from the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations).

I cleaned, merged and transformed this data. Exploring these databases using Python allowed me to find some answers regarding world hunger. In particular, I discovered certain food resources that were badly distributed and used.
